Martin, here is some feedback on the exceptionally well-developed website, **'Red Soup Restaurant'** using **HTML & CSS**. Your work showcases a commendable level of skill and expertise in web development. You particularly did well in the following areas:

Here are some aspects of the website that stood out:

1. The visual design was appealing with a harmonious colour scheme, well-chosen typography, and an overall aesthetic that aligned with the website's purpose and target audience. The layout is well balanced allowing for easy readability and navigation.

2. The website displays excellent responsiveness across different web browsers and screen sizes.

3. Clear and intuitive navigation which is logical and user-friendly. It is easy to find information and move through the website, thanks to well-placed menus, intuitive nav buttons, and appropriate use of visual cues. Users can navigate from one page to another without confusion or frustration.

4. You have employed semantic HTML, structuring the content in a meaningful and accessible way. Properly labeled headings, appropriate use of semantic elements, and descriptive alt text for images.

5. Clean and well-organised CSS code. This follows best practices making it easily readable and maintainable. Styles are consistently applied and selectors appropriately named, enhancing code clarity and reducing the potential for conflicts and errors.

6. The website loads quickly and easily, demonstrating your attention to performance optimisation. 

A bonus ***'like'*** for the inclusion of the self-made videos in your website, however, I would have liked to see the full recipe video - it cut out halfway through.

Overall, a very impressive website that showcases your technical prowess and commitment to delivering a top-notch user experience - Well done!
